## {metadata.title}

Is cheesecake your favorite dessert? Well it is mine but why?
Well it just tastes good and if it doesn't to you then I won't be able to change your mind.
				
It's like the [cilantro gene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OR6A2),
the one that makes it taste like soap but to me tastes fresh and citrusy.

Anyway, if it's your favorite or if you happen to like it I highly
recommend you bake one!

As far as baking goes it's a lot easier than I thought it would be.
You get so much more cheesecake than any one person can eat making it
perfect to share and you more likely than not have everything you need
in your kitchen if you have ever baked before. All I needed to buy was
creamcheese, graham crackers and fruit!

I used these recipes for the [cheesecake](https://www.onceuponachef.com/recipes/new-york-style-cheesecake.html#tabrecipe) and the [strawberry topping!](https://natashaskitchen.com/strawberry-sauce-recipe/) I also made blueberry topping just switch out the strawberries for blueberries and there's no need to slice them just lightly mash them as they cook!

Checkout the chessecake I made a couple of weeks ago :)
