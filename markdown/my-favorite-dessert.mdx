Is cheesecake your favorite dessert? Well, it’s mine but why?  
Well, it just tastes good! If it doesn’t taste good to you, I probably won’t be able to change your mind.

It’s like the [cilantro gene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OR6A2),  
the one that makes it taste like soap to some people, but to me it tastes fresh and citrusy.

Anyway, if it’s your favorite or if you just happen to like it I highly recommend you bake one!

As far as baking goes, it’s a lot easier than I thought it would be.  
You get so much cheesecake, more than any one person can eat, making it perfect to share. You’ll also likely already have everything you need in your kitchen if you’ve baked before. All I needed to buy was cream cheese, graham crackers, and fruit.

I used these recipes for the [cheesecake](https://www.onceuponachef.com/recipes/new-york-style-cheesecake.html#tabrecipe) and the [strawberry topping](https://natashaskitchen.com/strawberry-sauce-recipe/). I also made blueberry topping just switch out the strawberries for blueberries. There’s no need to slice them just lightly mash them as they cook.

Checkout the cheesecake I made a couple of weeks ago :)
