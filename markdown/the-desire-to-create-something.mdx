I feel this emptiness inside, part of my core. I need to create something, I want to find greatness and leave it behind for everyone else.

I look at my hand and squeeze my fist. I hear my knuckles and joints pop and crack. I reach out in front of me and feel like I'm leaning
against a wall with the inability to, at the very least, push against it.

    break through"

I like cooking and baking, why? I create something. It's tangible and relatively fast. It's something I can enjoy creating and consuming, 
all with in a single day. It's the instant gratification or immediate failure. That failure is welcomed. I made something and it was 
shit. Time to make it again.

I want to create something, not so consumable, not so fleeting.

<Quote
    quote="With apparently only one life to live on this earth, you ought to try to make significant contributions to humanity rather than just
    get along through life comfortably—that the life of trying to achieve excellence in some area is in itself a worthy goal for your life.
    It has often been observed the true gain is in the struggle and not in the achievement—a life without a struggle on your part to make
    yourself excellent is hardly a life worth living."
    cite="Richard W. Hamming, The Art of Doing Science and Engineering | Learning to Learn"
/>

I look around and think myself better. I receive a complement and humble myself. I'm not. People who strive for excellence are rare. I'm 
more of the same, just looking into mirror. Struggling with what's thrown at me, seeking momentary comfort.

<Quote
    quote="The man who is unwilling to exert himself almost always convicts himself as unworthy of good, since we gain every good by toil."
    cite="Musonius Rufus, That One Should Disdain Hardships"

/>

I want more. I won't be happy until I start wanting less. I need more and won't have it until I pursue a greatness.

**Does it matter if it isn't mine?**
