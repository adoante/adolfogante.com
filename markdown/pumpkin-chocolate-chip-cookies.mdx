- Measuring cups and spoons  
- Cookie scoop or large spoon  
- Cooling rack (optional)
## Notes

## Instructions

### 1. Prep
- Preheat oven to **375°F (190°C)**  
- Line baking sheets with parchment paper if desired
### 2. Pat Dry the Pumpkin
- Place pumpkin purée in a bowl  
- Pat dry with paper towels  
- Stir and blot again until the purée feels thicker  
- This helps prevent overly cakey cookies
### 3. Mix Wet Ingredients
In a large bowl:
1. Add sugar to pumpkin purée  
2. Mix until smooth  
3. Add oil  
4. Add vanilla extract  
5. Mix until glossy and fully combined
### 4. Mix Dry Ingredients
In a separate bowl, whisk together:
- Flour  
- Pumpkin pie spice  
- Cinnamon  
- Salt  
- Baking soda  
- Baking powder  

Whisk well to evenly distribute spices and leavening.
### 5. Combine Wet and Dry
1. Add **½ of the dry mixture** to the wet ingredients  
2. Mix until just combined  
3. Add remaining dry ingredients  
4. Mix gently until no dry flour remains  

Do **not** overmix.
### 6. Add Chocolate Chips
- Add chocolate chips  
- Fold gently with a spatula until evenly distributed
### 7. Scoop and Bake
- Scoop dough onto baking sheets, spacing cookies **2 inches apart**  
- Bake at **375°F for 15 minutes**  
- Cookies are done when edges are set and tops look matte
### 8. Cool
- Let cookies cool on baking sheets for **5 minutes**  
- Transfer to cooling rack if desired  
- Cookies will firm slightly as they cool while staying soft inside
