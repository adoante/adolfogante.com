Is coffee nothing by a bitter, medicine like, caffeine
delivery system to you?

Then I have the answer for you. Specialty, single
origin, roasted a week prior, freshly ground, brewed
to order coffee! I know its a mouthful

I was 22 years old when I started drinking coffee and
fell down a rabbit hole I am gladly still down. coffee
can be far more than just caffeine plus a sugar kick.

I highly recommend watching James Hoffmann on

and visiting his site at [**jameshoffmann.co.uk**](https://www.jameshoffmann.co.uk/)!
