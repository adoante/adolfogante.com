[This guy coded a project every week.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nr8biZfSZ3Y) Not every single project was technically impressive, particularly revolutionary or unique but this guy made something every single week. He set a challenge and completed it.

Game jams. A sprint to a, somewhat, completed game. [Brackeys 2025.2](https://itch.io/jam/brackeys-14) game jam received 2,280 entries and people submitted 42,400 ratings. My friend and I also submitted a [game](https://ado-ante.itch.io/dude-shootem-slot-fever). It was a week long process and it felt good.

A new years resolution. A set goal to start on January 1st. Most people just out right fail on the 1st. The date doesn't matter, it won't be any easier if you start on the 1st, the 15th or the following Monday. The time and place doesn't matter.

People love talking and talking about the things and people around themselves and especially when it involves them. Of course, that's the human condition and you can't fault them for it. So ignore the quips and comments of others about how unlike they thing your doing is to what your normally do. The thoughts and actions of others are out of our control. We can only control our own thoughts, what we think of the people and world around us. The emotions we experience are ours to do and direct as we see fit.

It time to set an arbitrary challenge.

Show the people around you as soon as possible. Let them make their comments, let them see the new norm.

**So, what's it going to be?**
